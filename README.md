# Udacity_Project-3---Quizapp
The QuizApp project, part of the udacity Nandegree, is a chance to showcase everything learned in so far. The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice.  What will I learn? This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:  Planning your app design before coding. Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code. Creating, positioning, and styling views. Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code. Commenting and documenting your code.
